Deprecated Zero Hour Cheat, for educational purposes only.

The game has started using the il2CPP compiler. Game structure is probably the same, but I have not looked at it in months.

Code is a mess, never intended on taking it so far. Just wanted to try some things out while learning a bit about the unoty game engine.

Menu is hardcoded trash.
